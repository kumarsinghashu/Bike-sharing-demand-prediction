1. **Model Evaluation**: After comparing the root mean squared error and mean absolute error of all the models, the XGBoost model outperformed others, achieving an accuracy of 94%. Therefore, this model is deemed the most suitable for predicting daily bike rental counts.

2. **Temperature Influence**: Analysis indicates a positive correlation between the total bike rentals and temperature per month. Warmer temperatures correspond to increased bike rental activity.

3. **Wind Speed and Humidity**: Interestingly, wind speed and humidity exhibit minimal fluctuation across months, suggesting they have negligible impact on bike rental patterns.

4. **Weather as Predictor**: The data underscores the significance of favorable weather conditions in influencing bike rental behavior. People tend to rent bikes more frequently on days with pleasant temperatures and clear visibility.

5. **Implications for Planning**: Understanding the relationship between weather and bike rental demand is crucial for urban planning. This insight suggests that incorporating weather forecasts into bike rental station planning could optimize their placement and utilization.
